# Intro-to-DS-udacity-Final-Project
Analysis of NYC subway and weather data for May 2011. 
The data was obtained from Udacity's Intro to Data Science class. The final project has five parts:

Statistical Test, Linear Regression, Visualization, Conclusion, and Reflection.

I intend to do all five parts on this repository.
